    Abstract—Model-based design using executable models has
    the potential to increase system design efficiency and accuracy
    significantly. In the paper we present an industrial application
    which covers system design issues in the area of avionics and
    airline operation, especially taking into account maintenance and
    logistics operations and their impact on fleet availability. Such a
    complex system needs to be modeled on a very abstract level of
    detail in the early phases of design, and undergoes a stepwise
    refinement throughout the further development. Executability of
    a model ensures that the model is a behavioral specification, and
    allows simulation runs for a performance evaluation of design
    alternatives. Decisions can thus be made with more confidence.
    We use the software tool MLDesigner in the paper, which is
    capable of modeling an evaluating hierarchical multi-domain
    models of complex systems. Different models of computation for
    submodels can be mixed, and an extensive library of predefined
    modules is available. We present parts of an abstract airline
    model from an ongoing project, which is used to evaluate, among
    others, resource availabilities.
